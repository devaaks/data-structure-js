# Linked List

## Singly Linked List
A singly linked list is a linear data structure. Each element, called a node, is connected to the other, by pointers (or references) to the next node.

## Doubly Linked List
A doubly linked list is the same as a singly linked list with the addition of previous pointers that point to the previous node.
In a doubly linked list, each node has two references: one to its previous node, and one to its next node (instead of only the next node in the singly linked list).
