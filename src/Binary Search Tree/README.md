# Binary Search Tree
In a binary search tree, the left child node is always smaller than the parent, and the right child is always greater than the parent, i.e., left child < parent node < right child

The node represented with the orange background is called the root node. Due to the sorted nature of the tree, we can easily search through the tree: letâ€™s say we want to find the value 17. Is it bigger or smaller than 15? Bigger, so we go right. Is 17 smaller or bigger than 18? Smaller, so we go left. And we found the node!
